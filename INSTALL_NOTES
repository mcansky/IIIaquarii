Installation notes and tips.

If you use RVM, you should put

  if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then
  . $HOME/.bashrc
  fi

in the ~/.bash_profile of the user which will host the app

You need to run periodically two rake tasks:

  rake sshkeys:export         # export ssh keys to authorized_keys file
  rake git:pull               # Check git repository for new commits

Be sure to run it with the RVM environment if you use it !

example:

  $ crontab -l
  */15 * * * * /usr/pkg/bin/bash -l -c '/home/aquarii/IIIaquarii/aq_cron.sh' >> /home/aquarii/cron.log 2>&1

where aq_cron.sh is you script running the rake tasks, an example is located in `vendor/'
